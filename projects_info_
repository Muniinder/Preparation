Tell me about your sap project:
It was a team project made in abap programming.
The two of us made custom screens, while others two works on reports and creation of data
We used object oriented approach to get things done.
We made custom screens, a report on sales, online login system to request for items which were 		given to us in srs document.
A user can request a particular item from built in functions we made, it can able to show the item,      	its, price ,quantity, its specifications in those screens
It involves getting data from the tables, updating it according to the requirement, joining and all.



E-book library-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nodejs built on top of js
Basically an infinite loop, getting request and puts into processing, whenever which request got completed, outputs the response
Its highly scalable
            




Web server ( httpserver.js ) created to handling http requests
Book_Routing is used to route the web pages, to trigger functionalities

NODEJS
1. Any JavaScript file which doesn't contain codes for browser interaction will execute successfully.
2. GET (url, http, QueryString and custom modules) POST (http, querystring, request.on    data,chunks,stringify, comes in json and validate)
3. Custom events
4. Routing:
Process Flow : Create Server-> HandleRequest(using request.url)->DecisionBasedOnUserClick (Route to login or signup by url parsing)->RouteHandler(display pages acc to request) -> Done
5. File System: read,write a file, using fs module, 
 streams, zlib used to compress, decompress, to write, read
