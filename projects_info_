It is SAP application to maintain the sales unit for the customers with an option to place inquiry, quotation and orders online.
All the screens were made in Dialog program and Web dynpro with an Object -Oriented Approach using ABAP programming
language.

Tell me about your sap project:
  - It was a team project made in abap programming.
  - The two of us made custom screens, while others two works on reports and creation of data
  - We used object oriented approach to get things done.
  - We made custom screens using Dialog Programming, a report on sales using Smart forms, online login system to request for items 
    using web dynpro .
  - A user can request a particular item from built in functions we made, it can able to show the item, its price ,quantity, its 
    specifications in those screens
  - It involves getting data from the tables, updating it according to the requirement, joining and all.

  -  To make tables we use abap data dictionary objects.
Tables:
  CUSTOMER        QUOTATION       ORDERS       ITEMS
Classes:
  Customer class
    - consist of customer id, order id, customer name, customer password
    - can place an order

E-book library-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nodejs built on top of js
Basically an infinite loop, getting request and puts into processing, whenever which request got completed, outputs the response
Its highly scalable
            
Web server ( httpserver.js ) created to handling http requests
Book_Routing is used to route the web pages, to trigger functionalities
Login_book is homepage
You can login, if account is not created , route to signup_book
after login,
	book details are shown in Details_book page, book details are fetched from json file
modules : fs

NODEJS
1. Any JavaScript file which doesn't contain codes for browser interaction will execute successfully.
2. GET (url, http, QueryString and custom modules) POST (http, querystring, request.on    data,chunks,stringify, comes in json and validate)
3. Custom events
4. Routing:
Process Flow : Create Server-> HandleRequest(using request.url)->DecisionBasedOnUserClick (Route to login or signup by url parsing)->RouteHandler(display pages acc to request) -> Done
5. File System: read,write a file, using fs module, 
 streams, zlib used to compress, decompress, to write, read



Questions : 
1.	diff b/w get and post
2.	what is an API
3.	diff b/w soap and rest API

Tell me about your e-library project :
	It’s a simple web application built in Nodejs, mongodb to store the information of users
	Users can signup, login, view the books , download them in zip format.


Resume Portal-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - It is a web based portal designed to collect resumes of students for Internships. It is divided into two major modules, PR
    section and Student section.
  - Students upload their latest resumes and PR can export them selectively to their google drive account.
  - I did the front-end part of this using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
  

Two tables made

students 
id, name, password, resume, information
admin
id, name, password
