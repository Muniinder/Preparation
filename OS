CPU SCHEDULING:
  CPU BOUND V/S INPUT BOUND
  PARAMETRES: burst, arrival, exit, waiting, turnAroundTime, response TIME
  
  ALGORITHMS FOR SCHEDULINGS:
    first come first serve
    shortest job first scheduling (non premptive), shortest remaining time (premptive) : best average time(i guess)
    priority scheduling(non premptive,premptive), ageing
    round robbin : best response time
